vpnc (0.5.3r550-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The Debian-specific "Target Networks" and "DNSUpdate" extensions, deprecated
  in wheezy, have now been removed. If you were still using them, please see
  README.Debian on how to upgrade your setup to use the upstream facilities
  instead.

  Another Debian-specific extension, action scripts called from vpnc-script
  before and after connect and disconnect processing, have been integrated
  upstream as hooks that call any script found in a specific directory. The
  package upgrade will make an attempt to move existing scripts to the new
  location, e.g. /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script-connect-action will be moved to
  /etc/vpnc/connect.d/vpnc-script-connect-action.
    
  Finally, vpnc now depends on the vpnc-scripts package to provide an
  up-to-date vpnc-script for both vpnc and openconnect. If you made
  modifications to vpnc-script, they have been backed up, but are no longer
  active. While you can reinstate your own script, you are encouraged to
  implement your modifications as separate hook scripts.
